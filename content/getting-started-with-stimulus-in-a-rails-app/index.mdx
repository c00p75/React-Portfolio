**[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)** is a popular web development framework known for its simplicity and developer-friendly
approach. Among its prominent advantages is the capability to provide many tools and libraries to make
web development easier and one of the exciting additions in recent years is
**[Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/)**. Stimulus is a JavaScript framework that complements
Rails beautifully, allowing you to add interactivity to your web applications with minimal effort.
It allows you to create a great user experience without needing a Javascript frontend framework or library
like React or Vue and is well-suited for implementing features such as form validation, modal windows/dialogs,
live updates, infinite scrolling, toggle visibility, drag and drop and so much more!

In this article, I'll introduce the basics of using Stimulus in a Rails application, making it
easy for beginners to get started. **It's important to note that Rails 7 is the latest release at the time of
this blog post.**

## What is Stimulus?

Stimulus is a JavaScript framework created by **[Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)** (formerly 37signals)
to help developers build rich, interactive user interfaces with ease. It follows a simple and unobtrusive
approach to augment your HTML elements with interactivity using JavaScript. The core philosophy of Stimulus
is to keep your JavaScript code focused, organized, and easy to maintain.

## Getting Started with Stimulus

### Installation
Stimulus comes built into a Rails 7 app, and has the following configurations already set up:
<ul>
  <li>
  All Stimulus controllers are exported from ```app/javascript/application.js``` and imported by
  ```importmap.rb```
  </li>
  <li>
  Import maps are added to ```views/layouts/application.html.erb``` :
  
  ```html
  <%= javascript_importmap_tags %>
  ```
  </li>
</ul>

If you are using a version lower than Rails 7 or Stimulus happens to be missing from your Rails application,
you can consult the **[gem documentation here](https://github.com/hotwired/stimulus-rails)**.

### Controllers
A Stimulus.js controller is a JavaScript class that extends the base Controller class from Stimulus.
These controllers act as encapsulated units of behavior and are responsible for defining and
managing the interactions associated with a specific HTML element. Each controller is associated with a DOM
element on which it can perform actions and updates, and can be generated with the command:
```ruby
rails generate stimulus controllerName
```
<br />

Let's take a quick look at the anatomy of the ```hello_controller.js``` that comes built into a Rails 7 app.

```javascript
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  // Controller logic
}
```
In the code above, the controller inherits from the base ```Controller``` class and exports it to
make it accessible for use in other parts of your JavaScript code.

#### Adding Behavior to Your Controller

Inside the exported functions of Stimulus controllers is the controller logic, as can be seen in 
the already setup ```hello_controller.js```.

```javascript
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  // Controller logic
  connect() {
    this.element.textContent = "Hello World!"
  }
}
```

In the code above, the ```connect``` method will be evoked when our controller connects to an html element
and we can nest our desired logic within it. In our case, we want to set the string ```"Hello World!"``` as the text
content of our target element.

I'd like to add that controllers can define various methods and each method corresponds to a specific
lifecycle event or action. Here are some common methods:
<ul>
<li>
```initialize()```: This is called once when the controller is first connected to an HTML element.
It's a good place to perform one-time setup.
</li>

<li>
```connect()```: This is invoked every time the controller is connected to an HTML element.
It's commonly used to set up event listeners or initialize variables.
</li>

<li>
```disconnect()```: This is called when the controller is disconnected from the HTML element and
is useful for cleanup tasks.
</li>

<li>
Custom Methods: Additionally, you can define custom methods based on the specific functionality
you want the controller to provide.
</li>
</ul>

#### Applying the Controller in Your HTML
Now, let's apply the controller to an HTML element. To access the controller from your HTML view file,
add the data-controller attribute with the controller name:

```html
<!-- app/views/hello/index.html.erb -->
<div data-controller="hello_controller">
  <!-- Your content here -->
</div>
```

In the code above, we've attached our ```hello_controller``` to a ```div```, making it the target element of
our controller. When the app is run with command ```rails server```, the ```div``` connects to the ```hello_controller```
and the ```connect()``` method is invoked, injecting the string ```"Hello World!"``` into the ```div```.
It's that simple!

## Practical Examples of Using Stimulus.js in Rails
Now that you have a good idea of how Stimulus.js is used in your Rails project, let's explore some practical
examples of how it can be used to enhance the user experience.

### Dropdown Menu
We can create a dropdown that reveals a list of options when clicked.

Generate a Stimulus controller for the dropdown:

```bash
rails generate stimulus Dropdown
```

Open ```app/javascript/controllers/dropdown_controller.js``` and define the dropdown behavior:

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/dropdown_controller.js
import { Controller } from "stimulus";

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["options"];

  toggle() {
    this.optionsTarget.classList.toggle("hidden");
  }
}
```

In this example, the ```toggle``` method toggles the visibility of the dropdown options by adding
or removing the ```hidden``` class.

Notice that this time we have included ```static targets = ["options"];```. 
In Stimulus.js, the ```static targets``` property is used to define named targets that your
controller can reference.  The ```static``` keyword indicates that the ```targets``` property is a static
property of the class, meaning it is *shared among all instances of the class.*

Add the HTML markup for the dropdown:
```html
<!-- app/views/dropdown/index.html.erb -->
<div data-controller="dropdown">
  <button data-action="click->dropdown#toggle">Toggle Dropdown</button>
  <ul data-dropdown-target="options" class="hidden">
    <li>Option 1</li>
    <li>Option 2</li>
    <li>Option 3</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

In this example, the data-controller attribute associates the dropdown controller with the containing div.
```click->dropdown#toggle``` specifies the event (click) and the action to be taken. When the element is clicked,
the ```toggle``` method in the ```dropdown_controller``` will be invoked.

Let's some basic CSS to style the dropdown.
```css
/* app/assets/stylesheets/application.css */
.hidden {
  display: none;
}
```

### Form Validation
Stimulus.js can be used to enhance the validation of a form.

```ruby
rails generate controller formValidationController
```

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/form_validation_controller.js
import { Controller } from "stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["input"]

  validate() {
    if (this.inputTarget.value.length < 3) {
      alert("Please enter at least 3 characters.")
    }
  }
}
```
Apply this controller to your form:

```html
<!-- app/views/forms/new.html.erb -->
<form data-controller="form-validation">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" data-target="form-validation.input">
  <button type="button" data-action="form-validation#validate">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Dynamic Content Loading
Imagine you have a list of items, and you want to load more items when the user scrolls to the bottom of the page.
Create a new controller, infinite_scroll_controller.js:

```ruby
rails generate controller infiniteScrollController
```

```javascript
// app/javascript/controllers/infinite_scroll_controller.js
import { Controller } from "stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
  static targets = ["items"]

  connect() {
    window.addEventListener("scroll", this.loadMore.bind(this))
  }

  loadMore() {
    if (window.innerHeight + window.scrollY >= document.body.offsetHeight) {
      // Fetch and append more items to the list
      console.log("Loading more items...")
    }
  }
}
```

Apply this controller to your HTML:

```html
<!-- app/views/items/index.html.erb -->
<div data-controller="infinite-scroll">
  <div data-target="infinite-scroll.items">
    <!-- Your list of items here -->
  </div>
</div>
```

The examples above showcase how Stimulus.js can seamlessly be integrated into a Rails project to add
interactive features without sacrificing the benefits of server-rendered HTML.

## Conclusion
Stimulus.js is a valuable addition to the Rails ecosystem, providing a pragmatic and lightweight approach
to adding client-side interactivity. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can start incorporating
Stimulus.js controllers into your Rails application and enhance the user experience with minimal overhead.
As your application grows, you can continue to leverage Stimulus.js to create dynamic and responsive interfaces
while maintaining the simplicity and elegance of the Rails framework.
